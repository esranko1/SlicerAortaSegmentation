# Aorta Segmentation for 3D Slicer

A [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) extension that segments the aorta from a single MRI volume using a pretrained nnU-Net v2 model. Select an input volume, click Apply, and get a 3D segmentation back in a few minutes.

Mean validation Dice (fold 0, internal validation set): **0.90**. This is a research tool, not a clinically validated or FDA-cleared product — don't use it for diagnosis.

## Requirements

- [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org/) 5.6 or later (developed against 5.10.0)
- PyTorch and NNuNet extensions (automatically installed via Extensions Manager)
- Internet connection on first use to download model weights (~100 MB, one-time)
- Optional: an NVIDIA GPU. The module auto-detects CUDA and uses GPU if available; without a GPU it falls back to CPU, which works but is considerably slower.

## Installation

Install via the **Slicer Extension Manager**:

1. In Slicer, go to **Modules → Extension Manager**.
2. Search for **"Aorta Segmentation"**.
3. Click **Install** (this also installs required dependencies: PyTorch and NNuNet).
4. Restart Slicer when prompted.
5. The module appears under the **Segmentation** category in the module dropdown, named **Aorta Segmentation**.

## Usage

1. Load your MRI volume into Slicer (drag and drop, or **File → Add Data**).
2. Open the **Aorta Segmentation** module.
3. Under **Inputs**, select your MRI volume as the **Input MRI volume**.
4. Under **Outputs**, select or create a segmentation node for the **Output segmentation**.
5. Click **Apply**.
6. First run only: the module downloads the pretrained model weights (~100 MB). This requires internet connection and happens once.
7. The status label shows progress while inference runs (typically a few minutes; longer on CPU). When done, a segment named **Aorta** appears in your output segmentation node, with a 3D surface generated automatically.

### Notes

- Only one volume is processed per run.
- The model expects a single-channel MRI volume; other modalities or multi-channel input aren't supported.
- Inference speed depends on hardware: GPU (NVIDIA CUDA) runs in ~2-5 minutes; CPU-only runs in ~10+ minutes.

## How the model was trained

The nnU-Net model behind this extension (custom trainer + a clDice-based topology-aware loss for preserving vessel connectivity) was trained in a separate repo: [Aorta-seg](https://github.com/esranko1/Aorta-seg), which covers data preprocessing, training, and postprocessing/QC.
